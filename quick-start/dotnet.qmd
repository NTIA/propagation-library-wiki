This  page provides a walkthrough on how to quickly get up and running calling the ITS Propagation Library packages from the .NET development environment.

## Dependencies and Limitations

Users are assumed to be developing in .NET Framework 4.7 or greater.  Explicit support is not present at this time for .NET Core, although it is being considered in the near future (if this is a requested feature, please reach out to [code@ntia.gov](mailto:code@ntia.gov) to bump its priority).

## Internal Package Repository
::: {.callout-warning}
Internal Repository to be Superceded

Soon, PropLib packages will migrate to public-facing package repositories. Check back later for updates.
:::

All packages are hosted on an internal NTIA NuGet Server.  The location of the server is dependent on your office (packages are cloned between the two locations):

ITS/Boulder: `\\ntinetapp001g.ntiadc.ntia.doc.gov\ntiadropbox\itsdata\NuGet` or `\\itsfs01\Tools\NuGet`

OSM/HCHB: `\\nthnetapp002g.ntiadc.ntia.doc.gov\ntiadropbox\itsdata\NuGet`

### Configuring Visual Studio

1. Open Visual Studio.
1. Open Options and Select *Package Sources* under NuGet Package Manager
