title: "NTIA/ITS Propagation Library Wiki"
---

The ITS Propagation Library currently supports C++, C#/.NET, MATLAB, and Python
users through exposing common functionality across multiple programming environments.
One of the key benefits of this approach is that users are assured of identical
results across languages, allowing researchers to work in their most efficient
development environment while benefitting from common library improvements.

## Quick Start

* For C++ developers, [Quick Start for C++](./quick-start/cpp.qmd)
* For .NET developers, [Quick Start for .NET](./quick-start/dotnet.qmd)
* For MATLAB developers, [Quick Start for MATLAB](./quick-start/matlab.qmd)
* For Python developers, [Quick Start for Python](./quick-start/python.qmd)
