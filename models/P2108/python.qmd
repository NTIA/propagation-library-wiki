This page details the installation and usage of the Python version of the U.S. Reference Implementation of Recommendation ITU-R P.2108.

{{< include /includes/_link_to_model_home.qmd >}}

## Installation

{{< include /includes/_pypi_distribution.qmd >}}

```default
pip install proplib-p2108
```

The following code snippet shows how to import the package and check the installed version:

```python
from ITS.ITU.PSeries import P2108
print(P2108.__version__)
```

{{< include /includes/_py_documentation_block.qmd >}}

```python
help(P2108.TerrestrialStatisticalModel)
```

## Examples

The following code examples show how each of the three models from Recommendation ITU-R P.2108 can be called from Python.

### Height Gain Terminal Correction Model

```python
# define inputs
f__ghz = 1          # Frequency, in GHz
h__meter = 1.5      # Antenna height, in meters
w_s__meter = 27     # Street width, in meters
R__meter = 20       # Representative clutter height, in meters
clutter_type = 6    # Clutter type, enum

# Call height gain terminal correction model (P.2108 Section 3.1)
A_h__db = P2108.HeightGainTerminalCorrectionModel(f__ghz, h__meter, w_s__meter, R__meter, clutter_type)
# A_h__db is approximately 25.54 dB

# can also use enum to provide clutter type
clutter_type = P2108.ClutterType.DenseUrban  # int value is 6
A_h__db = P2108.HeightGainTerminalCorrectionModel(f__ghz, h__meter, w_s__meter, R__meter, clutter_type)
# A_h__db is approximately 25.54 dB
```

### Terrestrial Statistical Model

```python
# define inputs
f__ghz = 3          # Frequency, in GHz
d__km = 0.5         # Path distance, in km
p = 50              # Percentage of locations, in %

# call terrestrial statistical model
L_ctt__db = P2108.TerrestrialStatisticalModel(f__ghz, d__km, p)
# L_ctt__db is approximately 26.63 dB
```

### Aeronautical Statistical Model

```python
# define inputs
f__ghz = 15         # Frequency, in GHz
theta__deg = 10     # Elevation angle, in degrees
p = 50              # Percentage of locations, in %

# call clutter model
L_ces__db = P2108.AeronauticalStatisticalModel(f__ghz, theta__deg, p)
# L_ces__db is approximately 14.33 dB
```
