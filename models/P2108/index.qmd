Recommendation ITU-R P.2108 (Prediction of clutter loss) provides three methods to predict terminal clutter loss.  Two of these methods are for terrestrial paths and one if for aeronautical paths.  Frequencies vary depending on the clutter model.

# Functions

## Height Gain Terminal Correction Model

This method, gives the median of losses due to different terminal surroundings. The possible mechanisms include obstruction loss and reflections due to clutter objects at the representative height, and scattering and reflection from the ground and smaller clutter objects. When using a computer implementation, with terrain profile extracted from a digital terrain model, and with the terminal surroundings defined by a clutter category, it is not practicable to identify individual mechanisms. The method used here distinguishes between two general cases: for woodland and urban categories. It is assumed that the dominant mechanism is diffraction over clutter. For other categories, it is assumed that reflection or scattering dominates.

This model in valid for frequencies from 0.03 to 3 GHz.

The model supports the following clutter types and their respective input value.  Note that for language-specific code, enumerations and/or constants are provided for easy-of-use.

| Clutter Type | Value |
|--------------|:-----:|
| Water/sea    |     1 |
| Open/rural   |     2 |
| Suburban     |     3 |
| Urban        |     4 |
| Trees/forest |     5 |
| Dense urban  |     6 |

Two parameters additional allow that define the clutter at the terminal allow for either path-specific definitions as well as provide default values.

### Street Width

The parameter `w_s__meter` defines the width of the street at the location of the terminal in clutter.  If site-specific information is not available, the value of 27 should be used.

### Representative Clutter Height

The parameter `R__meter` defines the representative clutter height at the location of the terminal in clutter.  Default values for each clutter type are listed in the below table:

| Clutter Type | `R__meter` |
|--------------|:----------:|
| Water/sea    |         10 |
| Open/rural   |         10 |
| Suburban     |         10 |
| Urban        |         15 |
| Trees/forest |         15 |
| Dense urban  |         20 |

## Terrestrial Statistical Model

This model gives equations that gives a statistical distribution of clutter loss. The model can be applied for urban and suburban clutter loss modelling.  Validity of the model is as follows:

 * Frequency range: 2 to 67 GHz
 * Minimum path length: 
   * 0.25 km (for the correction to be applied at only one end of the path)
   * 1.0 km (for the correction to be applied at both ends of the path)
 * Percentage locations range: 0 < `p` < 100

## Aeronautical Statistical Model

This model provides equations to calculate the statistical distribution of clutter loss where one end of the interference path is within man-made clutter, and the other is a satellite, aeroplane, or other platform above the surface of the Earth.  Validity of the model is as follows:

* Frequency range: 10 to 100 GHz
* Elevation angle range: 0 to 90 degrees
* Percentage locations range: 0 < `p` < 100
