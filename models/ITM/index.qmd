# Functions

## Point-to-Point Basic Transmission Loss (TLS)

Generate a basic transmission loss prediction by operating ITM in point-to-point mode.  Variabilities are provided as time, location, and situation percentages.

Example: [C#](ITM-(.NET)#point-to-point-basic-transmission-loss-tls) | [MATLAB](ITM-(MATLAB)#point-to-point-basic-transmission-loss-tls) | [Python](ITM-(Python)#site-specific-basic-transmission-loss-tls)

## Point-to-Point Basic Transmission Loss (CR)

Generate a basic transmission loss prediction by operating ITM in point-to-point mode.  Variabilities are provided as confidence and reliability percentages.

Example: [C#](ITM-(.NET)#point-to-point-basic-transmission-loss-cr) | [MATLAB](ITM-(MATLAB)#point-to-point-basic-transmission-loss-cr) | [Python](ITM-(Python)#site-specific-basic-transmission-loss-cr)

## Area Mode Basic Transmission Loss (TLS)

Generate a basic transmission loss prediction by operating ITM in area mode.  Variabilities are provided as time, location, and situation percentages.

Example: [C#](ITM-(.NET)#area-mode-basic-transmission-loss-tls) | [MATLAB](ITM-(MATLAB)#area-mode-basic-transmission-loss-tls) | [Python](ITM-(Python)#area-mode-basic-transmission-loss-tls)

## Area Mode Basic Transmission Loss (CR)

Generate a basic transmission loss prediction by operating ITM in area mode.  Variabilities are provided as confidence and reliability percentages.

Example: [C#](ITM-(.NET)#area-mode-basic-transmission-loss-cr) | [MATLAB](ITM-(MATLAB)#area-mode-basic-transmission-loss-cr) | [Python](ITM-(Python)#area-mode-basic-transmission-loss-cr)
