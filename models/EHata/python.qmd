## Basic Transmission Loss

```python
pfl = [5, 100, 5, 7, 2, 4, 7, 5]
f__mhz = 3500
h_b__meter = 25
h_m__meter = 1.5
env = ehata.Classification.Urban
rel = 0.5

A__db, ivals = ehata.Invoke(pfl, f__mhz, h_b__meter, h_m__meter, env, rel)
assert(A__db == 133.7836794567479)

# can use the intermediate values object to access additional information
# from the EHata prediction
print(f"The effective height of the base station is {ivals.h_b_eff__meter} meters")
# The effective height of the base station is 30.0 meters
```
